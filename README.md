# SAUNA

This is a Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) code for a wood fire heated sauna simulation.
FDS is a computational fluid dynamics open source software designed for fire simulation developed by NIST.
The code is a numerical reproduction of a sauna experiment performed at the Tampere University of Technology in Finland.
The goal of this study is to demonstrate that FDS is capable of reproducing the physical phenomena occuring in a wood fire
heated sauna, in order to use this software for sauna design and safety engineering.

The experimental and numerical study has been written in a report available here :

It has been shown that FDS performs reasonably well but some discrepancies between experimental and numerical results still exist.
The model can be checked and investigated in order to improve the results.

The uploaded model includes main comments in english. Other comments are in french (my native language).
